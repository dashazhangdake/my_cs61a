Taking a look at biz, we see that there is another while loop. Be careful to note that although the term being added to sum is cubed (i**3), i itself is only incremented by 1 in each iteration. This tells us that this while loop also executes n times, with each iteration taking constant time , so the total time of biz(n) is n x constant, or linear. Knowing the runtime of linear, we can conclude that each iteration of the while loop in bar is linear. Therefore, the total runtime of bar(n) is quadratic.\n",
