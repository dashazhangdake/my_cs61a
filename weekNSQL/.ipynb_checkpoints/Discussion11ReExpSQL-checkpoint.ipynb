    "# Regular Experessions\n",
    "Regular expressions are a way to describe sets of strings that meet certain criteria, and are incredibly useful for pattern matching.\n",
    "## Character classes\n",
    "A character class makes it possible to search for **any one** of a set of characters, you can **specify the set** or **use pre-defined** sets\n",
    "\n",
    "|Class| Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| ```[abc]``` | Matches **a, b, or c** |\n",
    "| ```[a-z]``` | Matches **ANY** character **between a and z**|\n",
    "| ```[^A-Z]``` | Matches **ANY** character that is **NOT** between **A and Z**|\n",
    "| ```\\d``` | Matches **digits**, equivalent to ```[0-9]``` |\n",
    "| ```\\D``` | Matches any **NON-digits**, opposite of ```\\d```, shortcuts below also have opposites|\n",
    "| ```\\w``` | Matches **ANY word characters**, equivalent to ```[A-Za-z0-9_]``` (*opposite of ```\\W```*)|\n",
    "| ```\\s``` | Matches **white space characters** (spaces, tabs, linebreaks), (*opposite of ```\\S```*) |\n",
    "| ```.``` | Matches **ANY** non-newline character |\n",
    "\n",
    "Character classes can be combined, like in ```[a-zA-Z0-9]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Patterns\n",
    "There are multiple ways to combine patterns together in ReExp\n",
    "\n",
    "|Combo| Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| ```AB``` | A match for **A followed immediately by one for B**. **Example**: **```x[.,]y```** matches ```x.y``` or ```x,y``` |\n",
    "|```A\\|B```| Matches **either A or B**. **Example**: **```\\d+\\|Inf```** matches either a sequence of digits or Inf|\n",

    "\n",
    "| Quantifiers Symbol| Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| ```a*``` | **zero or more** occurences of ```a``` |\n",
    "| ```a+``` | **one or more** occurences of ```a```|\n",
    "| ```a?``` | **zero or one** occurences of ```a``` |\n",
    "| ```a{2, 6}``` | **2 ~ 6** occurences (including 2 and 6) of ```a```, additionaly, ```a{2, }```means **At least 2** occurences of ```a```, and ```a{2}``` means **Exactly 2** occurences of ```a```|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Groups\n",
    "* **Parentheses** are used similarly as in arithmetic expressions, to **create groups**. For example, ```(Mahna)+``` matches strings with **1 or more \"Mahna\"**, like ```\"MahnaMahna\"```. \n",
    "* As a comparison, **Without** the **parentheses**, ```Mahna+``` would match strings with **\"Mahn\"** followed by 1 or more \"a\" characters, like **\"Mahnaaaa\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anchors\n",
    "Anchors are **unique** in that they **don't match characters** - instead, they **match positions** in a string where an expression could land\n",
    "\n",
    "| Anchors | Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| ```^``` | matches the **beginning** of a string |\n",
    "| ```$``` | matches the **end** of a string|\n",
    "| ```\\b``` | matches the **word boundary** (whitespace, punctuation)|\n",

    "## Special Characters\n",
    "The following **special characters** are used above to denote types of patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\\ / ( ) [ ] { } + * ? | $ ^ .```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means if you want to match one of those characters, you have to escape it using a backslash. For example, when trying to match ```\"(1+3)\"```, the corresponding **pattern** should be:\n",
